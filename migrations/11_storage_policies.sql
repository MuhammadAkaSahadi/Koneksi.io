CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to upload images"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'images');

-- 3. Allow authenticated users to update their uploaded images
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to update images"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'images');

-- 4. Allow authenticated users to delete their uploaded images
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to delete images"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'images');

-- 5. Allow public read access to all images in the bucket
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access to images"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
